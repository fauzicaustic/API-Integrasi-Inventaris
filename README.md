## 2. **Authentication Steps**

To use this API, you must first authenticate by obtaining an API key required for each request. Below are the steps for authentication:

### Steps to Obtain an API Key:

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Register for an Account** | Sign up on our developer portal via the [sign-up link](https://developer.example.com). |
| **2. Access API Key** | After signing up, log in to the portal and go to the 'API Keys' section. |
| **3. Generate API Key** | Click the "Generate API Key" button to create a new API key. |
| **4. Store API Key** | Copy and securely store the generated API key. This API key will be used for all your requests. Do not share your API key publicly. |

### Including API Key in Requests:
After obtaining the API key, you must include it in the request header for authentication. Below is the correct header format to use:


>Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
>

## 3. **Sample Request and Response**

Here is an example of a request and response for retrieving inventory data using the API:

### Request:
To fetch inventory data, send a GET request to the /inventory  endpoint.

```http
GET /inventory
Host: api.example.com
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
```

### Respons: 
If the request is successful, the response will contain a list of products in the inventory along with their available stock quantities.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    {
      "item": "Laptop",
      "quantity": 50
    },
    {
      "item": "Smartphone",
      "quantity": 200
    }
  ]
}
```
- **Status**: indicates the status of the request (e.g., success, error).
- **Data**: An array of product objects containing the item name and stock quantity.

## 3. **Troubleshooting For Common Errors**

Here are some common errors you might encounter while using the API, along with how to resolve them:

| Error Code | Description | Solution |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **400** | **Invalid API Key** | Ensure the API key you are using is correct and included properly in the header. Double-check that the API key is not expired or revoked. |
| **401** | **Unauthorized** | Ensure you are including the correct authentication header: Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>. |
| **404** | **Resource Not Found** | Verify the endpoint URL is correct. If you are trying to access inventory data that doesnâ€™t exist, check that the product ID or name is valid.|
| **500** | **Internal Server Error**| Try again later. If the issue persists, contact our technical support team. |
